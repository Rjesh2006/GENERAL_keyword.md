68. ## <ins>Container Orchestrastion üóù :-- ##
    
  - Container orchestration automatically provisions, deploys, scales, and manages containerized applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
  
   ![image](https://github.com/Rjesh2006/Rjesh2006/assets/143868643/37ce9ed7-75b1-4c0c-97c7-6fa939b00d2c)
 
  - **kubernates :**
  
     Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration platform, and has become an essential tool for DevOps teams.
    
    ![image](https://github.com/Rjesh2006/Rjesh2006/assets/143868643/aa9985c3-639e-4c4f-ab41-f56b92517ebe)
  
  
  - **why kubernates is famous ?**
  
reason for Kubernetes' popularity is its scalability. Kubernetes allows organizations to scale their containerized applications up or down based on demand, making it easy to handle traffic spikes and unexpected increases in user activity. Kubernetes also provides a high level of reliability and availability.1
  
  
 ### **whats cluster setup in conatainer orchestration** 
  
A Kubernetes cluster is a set of  nodes that run containerized    applications. Containerizing applications packages an app
with its dependences and some necessary services.
   
  
   - **paas:**
  
Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-basedapps 
to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications.
  
   - *Pass  prividers*
     
      ![image](https://github.com/Rjesh2006/Rjesh2006/assets/143868643/fe14a502-c878-42aa-aab0-27ca8832f855)
  
  
   - **master node:**
  
The master node is responsible for cluster management and for providing the API that is used to configure and manage resources within the Kubernetes cluster.
  
   - **worker nodes:**
  
Worker nodes within the Kubernetes cluster are used to run containerized applications and handle networking to ensure that traffic between applications across theclusterand from 
outside of the cluster can be
properly facilitated.
  
  
   - **scheduler:**
  
 The Kubernetes scheduler is a          control plane process which            assigns Pods to Nodes. 
  
  
   - **controller:**
  
a controller is a control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired  state.
  
  
   - **Api:**
  
The Kubernetes API server  validates and configures data for the api objects which include pods, services, replicationcontrollers, and others. The API Server services REST 
operations and provides the frontend to the cluster's shared state through which all other  components interact.
  
  
   - **ETC'd( database):**
  
etcd is an open source distributed key-value store used to hold and manage the critical information that distributed systems need to keep running. Most notably, it manages the 
configuration data, state data, and metadata for Kubernetes,
  
  
  - **kubelet:**
  
The kubelet is responsible for ensuring that containers specified in pod configuration are running on a specific node, and manages their lifecycle.. It executes the actions  commanded by your control plane.
  
  - **kubeproxy:**
  
kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept. kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These 
network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or
outside of your cluster.


  ***cluster setup tools:--***
  
  - **yaml file:**
  
YAML is a human-friendly language. In the context of Kubernetes, YAML files are mainly used for the configuration of K8 pods, services, and deployments.
  
  - **kubedeam:**
  
Kubeadm is a tool used to build Kubernetes (K8s) clusters. Kubeadm performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable cluster up and running quickly. By design, it cares only about bootstrapping, not about provisioning machines (underlying worker and master nodes).
