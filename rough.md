15. **FRP (Functional Reactive Programming):**
    - **Programming paradigm for reactive systems:** Combines functional programming and reactive programming concepts to model and handle asynchronous data streams.
    - **Declarative composition of event-driven programs:** Emphasizes the declarative specification of event flows and data dependencies.

16. **Stub:**
    - **Client-side proxy for remote objects:** Represents a local object that acts as a surrogate for a remote object in a distributed system.
    - **Handles communication details:** Manages network communication, parameter marshalling, and error handling on behalf of the client.

17. **Skeleton:**
    - **Server-side counterpart to a stub:** Implements the remote interface methods defined by the stub on the server side.
    - **Marshals and unmarshals method invocations:** Translates method calls and parameters into network messages and vice versa.

18. **Marshalling:**
    - **Process of converting data into a format suitable for transmission:** Involves serializing data structures into a byte stream for network communication.
    - **Handles data representation differences:** Ensures compatibility between different platforms, languages, and architectures.

19. **Unmarshalling:**
    - **Process of reconstructing transmitted data back into its original format:** Deserializes received byte streams into data structures in memory.
    - **Involves interpretation and validation:** Converts raw data into meaningful objects based on predefined schemas or protocols.

20. **CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture):**
    - **Middleware standard for distributed computing:** Defines a platform-independent architecture and infrastructure for building distributed systems.
